# TrainerRoadOverlay
An AutoHotkey script to make TrainerRoad partially transparent to overlay on other applications.</br>
You will need to run TrainerRoad in compatibility mode for Windows Vista.</br>
This requires AutoHotkey to be installed: https://www.autohotkey.com/</br>
Once AutoHotkey is installed, you can just run TrainerRoadOverlay.ahk by double clicking on it.</br>
Win+shift+t will make the TrainerRoad window (best used with the minimal version) partially transparent.</br>
Win+shift+r will reset it (providing the TrainerRoad window is active.</br>
